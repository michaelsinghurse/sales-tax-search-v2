# Sales Tax Search

Sales Tax Search is a web application designed to assist tax preparers and
accountants with the often tedious task of looking up sales tax rates.

*This is the second version of the app. The first version does not use React or
any front-end frameworks or routing libraries. Here's the link to it:
